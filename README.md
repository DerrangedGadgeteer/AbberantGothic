I'd grown up fascinated with detective stories, and that fascination had driven the course of my life up until very recently.  Finally out of school, and after a couple years of training, I was sworn in as a deputy to my hometown's sherriff department.  But I was barely a month into my career when it happened...

About a year ago, at one of the big bowl games, a bunch of psycho cultists did something.  We were told at first it was a "Bomb Threat."  But it wasn't no bomb.  They'd dug up some kinda artifact, some kinda magic-majigger and they cracked it open on national TV.  It looked like fireworks at first, but over the next few hours we saw this glitterey stuff falling outside our homes.  And once it settled and disappeared, the whole world went mad.

Magic turned real.

Now all of a sudden, people started exhibiting supernatural powers.  Animals shapeshifted into monsters, mixtures of substances started exhibiting new, wierd properties.  Drawings, figures, even arrangements of spoken words, dances, and music started to bend reality in unpredictable ways.  Often enough, the results were devastating.  

The big cities got it the worst.  They turned from the homes of thousands, into chaotic wastelands where unspeakable creatures roam, where buildings don't keep the same number of rooms from moment to moment, where time wobbles and loops on itself, where fire or lightning spring out of nowhere, and even sometimes the air just disappears.  We haven't heard from any other communities bigger than a couple hundred people since the incident.  

But that's not to say the spaces between the the cities was safe... Monsters and abberations have sprung up in the woods, lakes, rivers, and all over the countryside.  Some followed the pattern of folktales and urban legends, while others appear to be completely new.  All the same, it's less dangerous than the certain death that awaits in the ruins of our once-great cities.  

Those of us lucky enough to survive the initial chaos formed small communities far from the urban centers.  And in a last-ditch effort to maintain some kind of order, the government sent out a radio order: "Any existing sworn officers of the law are hereby deputized as "Marshals," and they are hereby empowered and expected to uphold the laws of our nation, and of the communities they protect by whatever means are at their disposal." 

There were only four of us around to get that order, and since then, we've lost all but myself.  So now, as more and more of our neighboring communities seem to wink out of existence, it's down to me to investigate crime, handle the law, and to protect what little is left of my hometown from threats both natural, and supernatural.
