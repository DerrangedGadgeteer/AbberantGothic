# Demo Mission Notes & Story Beats

## Opening Crawl

The Brotherhood of Dusk, a somewhat troublesome cult your town has been quietly ignoring for several months now, has made it clear they're a threat that can no longer be tolerated.  After going quiet a few weeks ago, the cult abducted David Mathers, father of one of their converts.  It's up to you, Marshall, to find out what happened to him, and to ascertain if the Brotherhood is a threat to more people from your town.  

It isn't long after you arrive, that both questions are answered...  You see Mr. Mathers' corpse hung on hooks over the door to the theater The Brotherhood have claimed as their "church."  You have just enough time to grab your gear, as a cultist steps outside to meet you.

## Gameplay Start

### Out front of cultist base.
One cultist in front of player.
> Cultist:
>  > "My brothers!  Prepare!  The boots of the tyrant march on our holy soil!"

> Player:
>  > "Stop right there!"

Cultist is scripted to flee from the player and run into the base.  If the player lets him get into the base, he will despawn and the whole base will be set to condition Orange.  If the player kills the cultist, the base will be condition White. 

If the player captures the cultist:
> Cultist:
>  > "Don't you DARE defile our holy temple!"

> Player:
>  1. "You mind explaining that body hanging up there?"

>  > Cultist:
>  >  "He did the work of the tyrant too! You'll hang with him soon!"

>  > Player:
>  >  >  1. "Oh? How So? What did he do?"

>  >  >  Cultist:
>  >  >  > "If you come in with me... I'm sure The Great Speaker could teach you"

>  >  >  Player:
>  >  >  > 1. "Alright, but keep your hands out of your pockets, and no sudden moves." Cultist resumes scripted movement into the base, but at partial speed.
>  >  >  > 2. "I'm sure he can, now hands behind your back."

>  >  >  >  Cultist:
>  >  >  >  "Never you bastard!  Brothers! Help me!" resumes fleeing, and can no longer be captured.

>  >  >  2. "Hmm, That's nice, now, hands behind your back, you're under arrest!

>  >  >  Cultist:

>  >  >  "Never you bastard!  Brothers! Help me!" resumes fleeing, and can no longer be captured.

>  2. "You're under arrest, stay right here!"

>  >  "Never you bastard!  Brothers! Help me!" resumes fleeing, and can no longer be captured.
